### I like this! How can I help?

All you need to do is to take the pledge. Commit to publishing your first-author research exclusively in non-profit and scholarly society-owned journals. It's that simple!

You can also help by spreading the word! Share the pledge with your colleagues and on social media to raise awareness about the importance of ethical publishing practices. Put it in your email signature, talk about it at conferences, and encourage others to take the pledge as well.

Here's one you can copy and paste:

> I pledge to publish my first-author research exclusively in non-profit and scholarly society-owned journals [https://www.nonprofitpublishingpledge.com](https://www.nonprofitpublishingpledge.com)

You can also help by [**registering your interest in the pledge here**](https://forms.gle/txXroPWFBLvFTwJJ9). This will help us gauge support and build a community of like-minded researchers.

And finally, you can help by contributing to the project! If you know of any non-profit or society-owned journals that are not listed on the site, please submit a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/davidyshen/nonprofit_publishing).
