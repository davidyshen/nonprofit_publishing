#### Ok then, I'm on board! But where should I publish my research?

There are lots of great journals out there owned by non-profit societies and organisations! Here are some examples:

<div class="overflow-x-auto mt-6">
    <table id="journals-table" class="display nowrap" style="width:100%">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <!-- Headers will be generated dynamically from CSV -->
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <!-- Data will be loaded dynamically via JavaScript -->
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
